  Like the clock face, the Tarot lays out a cycle. That same repeating sequence
  which maps out the way in which one moment becomes the next. The cards
  represent the morning, noon, and night, youth, middle age and death. The cards
  tell the cycle of life.

Like the clock face, the Tarot lays out a cycle. That same repeating sequence which maps out the way in which one moment becomes the next. The cards represent the morning, noon, and night, youth, middle age and death. The cards tell the cycle of life.
