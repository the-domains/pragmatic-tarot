The ideas expressed on this website are the result of about 20 years of fiddling. They are personal understandings and come from no higher source other than the gods of experimentation.

It is my belief that there is no "Truth" in the Tarot. The cards are simply a way to help us understand the world. I will change my understanding, and soon enough, the ideas expressed here will be out of date to me, and need to change.

Any documents and concepts shared here should be used simply as tools for further exploration. They may help, they may not. I hope they do.
