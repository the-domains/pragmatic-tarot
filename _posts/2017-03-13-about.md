# A foolish journey

The ideas expressed on this website are the result of about 20 years of fiddling. They are personal understandings and come from no higher source other than the gods of experimentation.

It is my belief that there is no "Truth" in the Tarot. The cards are simply a way to help us understand the world. I will change my understanding, and soon enough, the ideas expressed here will be out of date to me, and need to change.

Any documents and concepts shared here should be used simply as tools for further exploration. They may help, they may not. I hope they do.

## My journey

I discovered Tarot when I was 20 and have kept cards on me ever since. I found the cards because I was looking for some universal structures to stories and myths. The tarot seemed to have some insights on the topic, and when I did a little more reading and exploring, I found something much bigger.

As a programmer by profession I found that the cards had a very clear system by which they worked. I have spent 20 years pulling the deck apart and trying to understand it's mechanics. After about a decade I decided I had a nice, clear logical system that could explain everything. Unfortunately, this clear rational approach got punctured by a simple question, "So when does your intuition take over?".

Over the next 10 years I came to respect that the intuition was an equal part of the process. We forget to value the irrational, and the Tarot has taught me so much about the importance of left and right balance.

The Tarot has defined my outlook on the world, it has given me tools that I apply in every aspect of my life. The ability to work with change and the unknown is now the foundation of all my professional work.

I love these cards and what they have taught me, and I truly think that learning to read this book will make your life better.
