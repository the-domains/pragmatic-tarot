  The idea that the Tarot magically tells the future is a nice one, and one that
  has given many people power over the years, but it is a superstition. Perhaps
  some people are able to tell the future, but that would have nothing to do
  with pictures on some pieces of cardboard.

# **The Tarot tells no fortunes.**

### **The Tarot cards allow us to use both logic and intuition to aid our understanding of the world around us. Tarot defines a set of stages in an archetypal change process. By learning the cards one is able to recognise the natural patterns that constantly appear in our lives.**

The idea that the Tarot magically tells the future is a nice one, and one that has given many people power over the years, but it is a superstition. Perhaps some people are able to tell the future, but that would have nothing to do with pictures on some pieces of cardboard.

The Tarot does however provide a way to interpret patterns, and by using pictures rather than words, it allow the intuition to inform some very interesting leaps in understanding. These jumps can feel like magic, but they are a product of our sub-conscious. (But, that is such a mysterious thing, it might as well be magic.)
