# **The Tarot tells no fortunes.**

### **The cards allow us to use both logical and intuitive pattern recognition to aid our understanding of the world around us. Change is the only constant, and Tarot is a classification system of an archetypal change process. In learning the cards one is able to better discern the natural, cyclical changes that constantly effect our lives. **
