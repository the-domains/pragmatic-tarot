# Pragmatic Tarot Reference Spread

The Tarot is the best reference material for learning Tarot. To use the tarot, you need to trust your intuition, and you can't do that if you keep checking a book.

The Tarot plots the universal pattern of life from beginning to end. To learn the cards, you need to learn the pattern..... _and the simplest way to do that is to count from 1 to 10\._

The reference spread makes learning the cards (a little) easier by aligning the major arcana with the minor arcana. The major and minor cards tell the same story in the same sequence. Understand the sequence from 1 to 10, and look for connections.
