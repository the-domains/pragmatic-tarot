Pragmatic tarot is a system for learning and understanding the cards. The pragmatic approach asserts that we simply need to understand one universal change process: **We need to know how things begin, grow older, end and start over.**

If we understand how this process is represented in the sequence of numbers from 1 to 10, we can deduce the meanings of all the cards - without any further reference material. **There is no secret knowledge required to understand the tarot. There are no special abilities needed.**

This universal cycle can be found in the Zodiac, the Kabbalah, and in many other systems. If we step back and look at our world with a little perspective, we can see the pattern all around us. There are common properties that can be identified in the phases of transformation of young through to old, of morning through to night, of spring through to winter. It is the exploration of these properties that has formed the foundation of every esoteric system. The Tarot is simply a pictorial representation of this universal pattern.

To learn the Tarot, simply study how things change.
